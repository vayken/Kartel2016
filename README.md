# Kartel2016 Student Union
My first website for the Student Union of my school Télécom Sudparis

This is the first website that I have ever done, in HTML, CSS, JavaScript(JQuery), PHP and SQL.

I have made this website for the Student Union of my school, which is currently in French.

This website has two parts : 

- One professional part for the different companies that would like to sponsor the Student Union (goodies, promotion, etc)

- One part for the students of the school to see and enjoy. (Require a Facebook Connect identification)

This project was the first web project that I have worked on. I worked on it alone, and it allowed me to hone my skills in the field of web development. Indeed, it is often not enough to only learn programming languages from books alone.

The file index.php is the page where the user will land once he goes on the website.

Downloading the whole project will take some times, as there are many media files that are included such are videos, soundtracks, etc.

If you want to download the project for testing purposes, you can download the zip file Kartel2016.zip that contains the website source code, without all those heavy media files.
